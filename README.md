# canvas-experiments

This project is experimenting with different ways of creating a pen
based notetaking/drawing system for the browser.  It contains a few
things:
+ Trying out flask and python as an alternative to nodejs (kinda liking
  it)
+ Socket io communication for connected client (creating a shared
  whiteboard)
+ A concept for writing notes with a stylus where you have a zoomed in
  block which is the writing area that gets rendered in the larger
  canvas and automatically shifts as you reach the end of the block
  (need a video)

## UPDATE

This has a achieved a MVP for a handwritten note-taking app that runs***very specifically*** on the iPhone using mobile Safari.
